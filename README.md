# A Stark Difference in Design
The Stark blog is a place for product people to journal everything from opinions and initial hypothesis to process, research, and results, in an effort to contribute toward solving the world’s greatest problems.

## Contributing
### Who can contribute
Anyone really! We foresee this being a culmination of posts from designers, engineers, product managers, C-Level folks, etc.

### Topics we think are necessary
- Accessibility (purpose, how-to, building products, etc.)
- Beyond the screen
  - Alternative input and output methods
  - Service design
  - Architecture
  - Illustration
- Hypothesis → Results
- Ethical design and building
- Case studies
- Data
- Psychology
- Color
- Typography
- …and more

### How it works
#### SUBMITTING
- 💌 Submit a proposal for a new or a previously published piece via our Github issues. (The template is already in there be it a proposal for both)
- 🏷 Label it accordingly
- 💬 We’ll reply within a a few hours to a couple days.
- 🚫 If we say no, we’ll tell you exactly why and help you shape the idea we think could fit best (if you want!).
- ✅ If we say yes, you work on it and submit whenever works best for you.
- 👀 Worried someone in the community may see your topic idea, steal and write about it before you can? It technically can happen, but the odds are statistically proven to decrease when you share it + generally speaking this community is very helpful.

#### WRITING
We don’t care how long a post takes to write because good things take time. Much like the newsletter, we want to ensure this blog is a place for signal rather than noise. And let’s be honest, the world is noisy enough ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### Code of Conduct
We’re firm believers that the world is better in color, with a variety of shapes, sizes and opinions. We value disagreement but we have zero tolerance for harassment, bullying, racism, sexism or discrimination of any kind. See anything of this going on? Approach [Cat](http://twitter.com/imcatnoone) about it immediately. We're a community of folks coming together to ideally make the world a better place. Don't be an asshole.
