# A Stark Difference in Design
The Stark blog is a place for product people to journal everything from opinions and initial hypothesis to process, research, and results, in an effort to contribute toward solving the worldâ€™s greatest problems.

## Contributing
### Who can contribute
Anyone really! We foresee this being a culmination of posts from designers, engineers, product managers, C-Level folks, etc.

### Frequency
We donâ€™t care how long a post takes to write because good things take time. Much like the newsletter, we want to ensure this blog is a place for signal rather than noise. And letâ€™s be honest, the world is noisy enough Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

Also, contribute as much as you're willing to submit proposals for. You're not required or on the hook for anything. We do ask that if you commit to a deadline you try to keep us posted if something is running behind.

### Writing
- We use Kirby for our blog. Once your proposal is accepted, we'll go ahead and invite you to the dashboard so you can get started.
- After or during writing, we're happy to proof-read it for you.
- When you're ready, toss it into Kirby (more coming soon on how to use the dashboard -- it's super simply) and keep it set to `invisible`
- We'll review it and let you know our thoughts or if it's ready to go live :)

*More on this coming soon, or at least revisions to this section*

### Topics we think are necessary
- Accessibility (purpose, how-to, building products, etc.)
- Beyond the screen
  - Alternative input and output methods
  - Service design
  - Architecture
  - Illustration
- Hypothesis â†’ Results
- Ethical design and building
- Case studies
- Data
- Psychology
- Color
- Typography
- â€¦and more

### How it works
#### SUBMITTING
- ðŸ’Œ Submit a proposal for a new or a previously published piece via our Github issues. (The template is already in there be it a proposal for both)
- ðŸ’¬ Weâ€™ll reply within a a few hours to a couple days.
- ðŸš« If we say no, weâ€™ll tell you exactly why and help you shape the idea we think could fit best (if you want!).
- âœ… If we say yes, you work on it and submit whenever works best for you.
- ðŸ‘€ Worried someone in the community may see your topic idea, steal and write about it before you can? It technically can happen, but the odds are statistically proven to decrease when you share it + generally speaking this community is very helpful.

### Code of Conduct
Weâ€™re firm believers that the world is better in color, with a variety of shapes, sizes and opinions. We value disagreement but we have zero tolerance for harassment, bullying, racism, sexism or discrimination of any kind. See anything of this going on? Approach [Cat](http://twitter.com/imcatnoone) about it immediately. We're a community of folks coming together to ideally make the world a better place. Don't be an asshole.
